# General Data Model for Experimental Workflow Management

This repository contains the implementation of a general data model for managing experimental workflows and associated data,
developed as part of an MEng Bioengineering project at Imperial College London.

## Project overview
The main objective of this project was to develop a robust, flexible, and efficient data model to manage experimental workflows and
their associated data in synthetic biology labs. This model aims to enhance the accuracy of workflow data reporting, thereby improving
replicability, reproducibility, and overall efficiency.
